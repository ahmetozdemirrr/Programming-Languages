# Cargo Tracking System

This repository contains the implementation of two parts of Homework #4 for the Programming Languages course (Fall 2023) at Gebze Technical University.

## Part 1: Prolog Expert System for Campus Deliveries

### Overview

In this part of the homework, a Prolog expert system is implemented for scheduling pickup and deliveries in a small college campus. The system includes delivery personnel, places for pickups and deliveries, objects to be delivered, and a map showing routes between places.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have a Prolog interpreter installed (e.g., SWI-Prolog).
2. Load the `part_1.pl` file:

```bash
consult('part_1.pl').
```
3. Query the expert system:

```bash
available_delivery_person(ObjectID, DeliveryPerson).
```

### Part 2: Prolog Expert System for Campus Deliveries

## Overview

In this part, a decision tree is built using the IRIS machine learning dataset. The decision tree is then implemented in Prolog to classify given input attributes.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have a Prolog interpreter installed (e.g., SWI-Prolog).
2. Load the `part_2.pl` file:

```bash
consult('part_2.pl').
```
3. Query the decision tree:

```bash
classify(4.9, 2.4, 3.3, 1.0, ClassLabel).
```
