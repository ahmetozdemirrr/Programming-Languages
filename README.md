# Programming-Languages

The codes I wrote here consist of programming assignments given to us in the Programming Languages course. In the 2nd and 3rd assignments, an interpreter was written with Yacc and Common Lisp for a language called G++. The first assignment is an article, while the last assignment contains two Prolog programmes. You can reach below for detailed information.

1. [Comparison-of-C-and-C++](/Comparison-of-C-and-C++) - Article about differences between C and C++ programming language
2. [Lexer-for-G++](/Lexer-for-G++) - A lexical analyser for a made-up language called G++.
3. [G++-Interpreter](/G++-Interpreter) - The interpreter of the G++ language was also written here.
4. [Cargo-tracking-system-with-Prolog](/Cargo-tracking-system-with-Prolog) - Here, a cargo tracking system and a decision tree for the IRIS data set were written using Prolog language.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification. Happy coding! ðŸš€
